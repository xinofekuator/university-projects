Slides: slides explaining what we did.

Code: pyOcr.py, image_features.py, solr_wrapper.py
The first two are used to get the json files that are stored in the results folder.
These json files are obtained from the images in all the other folders.
From those json files solr_wapper.py allows you to put them into Solr and query them.
