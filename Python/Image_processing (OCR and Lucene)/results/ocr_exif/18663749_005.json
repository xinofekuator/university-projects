The radioprotective effect of WBH, as observed in normal mice,\ndiminished in tumour bearing mice depending upon the size of tumour. Treatment of tumour\nbearing mice with mild WBH, 20h prior to local irrradiation (LIR), did not protect the\ntransplanted tumour against radiotherapy with a single dose of 20 Gy or fractionated dose\n(in \ufb01ve fractions) of 7.5 Gy on alternate days. In fact, mild WBH treatment enhanced the\ntumour regression and increased the mean survival time after fractionated dose therapy.\nHowever, the prior mild WBH was found to be ineffective in protecting normal tissue, as\nassessed by skin contraction after local irradiation (50 Gy). This indicates that mild WBH\ntreatment given 20 h prior to local radiotherapy enhances \ufb01brosarcoma tumour regression but\ncannot protect skin (normal tissue) against local irradiation. It appears that radioprotection of\nanimals by WBH may be the consequence of its radioprotective effect on haemopoietic tissues\nmediated through certain cytokines. Perhaps WBH may not have a radioprotective effect on\nother tissues, as evident from skin contraction studies.\n\nKey words.\u2018 Whole body hyperthermia, radiotherapy, \ufb01brosarcoma, local irradiation.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nRecent studies from the laboratory have demonstrated that mild WBH (40\u201cC for\nl h) given 20 or 48 h prior to 9.0 Gy TBI results in protection of a signi\ufb01cant number\nof mice, as assessed by their survival\u2018. Similar WBH\u2014induced radioprotection was\nreported by Shen et al.3. They have shown 100% protection of DBA/2 mice when\nexposed to 9 Gy TBI, 20h after WBH (microwave heating, 40C for 1 h) treatment.\nThis radioprotection has been attributed to immunological changes, mediated\nthrough certain cytokines, particularly interleukin-I (IL-1). It is known that expo-\nsure to WBH increases the levels of several cytokines like IL-la, IL-13, IL-6, IL-10,\nIL-12, TNF-/3, G-CSF and SCF\u201c. The administration of some of these cytokines\nand growth factors externally has been shown to radioprotect haemopoietic stem\ncells\u201d 7 and gastrointestinal crypt cells\u201c. The WBH thus holds a great promise as a\nradioprotector in protecting normal tissues surrounding and underneath a tumour\nduring radiotherapy of cancer. It was, therefore, considered of interest to investigate\nthe response of tumour and normal tissue to radiation therapy after whole body\nhyperthermia treatment.
