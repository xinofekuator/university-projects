Circular arrays\nare considered with a radius of up to \ufb01ve wavelengths. The number of sources\nand their positions in the array are varied, and the in\ufb02uence of these variations on\nthe primary and secondary hot spots is observed. It is found that the primary hot\nspot reaches its \ufb01nal shape with the addition of a very small number of sources to\nthe array. An increase in the number of sources results in a reduction of the\nnormalized magnitude of the secondary hot spots, but the size of the normalized\nprimary hot spot remains the same. An upper limit of sources in the array exists\nafter which no further reduction of the secondary hot spots is observed. The\n\ufb01nite-dilference time-domain method (F DTD) is used to obtain the electric-\ufb01eld\ndistribution in the inhomogeneous medium. A genetic algorithm is then applied to\n\ufb01nd the optimal positions of the antennae in the array.\n\nKey words: Focal regions, optimization, genetic algorithms.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nComputer simulations of energy depositions and temperature distributions in\nhuman bodies have helped to understand and improve the treatment of cancer\nthrough electromagnetic heating1\u20192. They have developed from two-dimensional\nsimulations to complex three\u2014dimensional simulation and optimization techniques\nfor treatment of individual patients] .\n\nPhased annular antenna arrays are generally used in simulations of heating deep-\nseated tumours non\u2014invasively. These kinds of applicators are commercially avail-\nable (e.g. the Sigma applicator from BSD Medical Corporation Salt Lake City,\nUtah, USA) and are commonly used in clinical hyperthermia applications\u201c. The\nphases and amplitudes of these arrays can be controlled individually so that it is\npossible to steer the hot spot inside the array6.\n\nA variety of numerical techniques can and have been used for the computer\nsimulations. These techniques can be divided into frequency-domain and time-\ndomain methods. The \ufb01nite element (FE) method, which is a frequency-domain\nmethod, is being used for hyperthermia treatment planning at a number of institu-\ntions5\u20187. The FE method has been optimized to reduce the calculation time of the\n\ufb01eld problem and has been integrated well into the treatment planning process.\n\nThis paper applies the \ufb01nite\u2014difference time-domain (FDTD) method to a two-\ndimensional inhomogeneous medium. This time-domain method has been applied to\n\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed. e-mail: fh@ee.duke.edu\n\nlntcrnulimiul Journal of\ufb02ypertliermiu ISSN 026541736 print/ISSN I46-4v5l57 onlinc (1 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd\nhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals\nDOI: 10.1080/02656730110055973\n\n \n\nproblems in hyperthern\nimplementation, the po\nfrequencies in one run\nand the possibility of 01\nand travelling through\nIn the case of a rar\narray, it is likely that In\nmethod, may not \ufb01nd I\nduced to \ufb01nd the optirr\nThe genetic algorithm\nsuccessfully to a numl\nimitates the mechanics\nBesides positioning\npaid to secondary hot\ntissue\u201d.
