Individually marked \ufb01sh were repetitively blood\nsampled for up to 19 days. Total serum protein concentrations remained\nconstant throughout the experiment indicating that the sampling regime did\nnot cause haemodilution. The alternative complement pathway activity\n(measured by the titre of haemolytic activity against rabbit erythrocytes) in\nthe serum of saline injected \ufb01sh remained constant but in LPS-injected \ufb01sh it\nfell to barely detectable levels 2 days after injection, but recovered to\npre-treatment levels by about day 5. Triploid \ufb01sh took slightly longer to reach\nfull recovery levels than diploids. All groups of \ufb01sh showed a hypoferraemic\nresponse, suggesting that the sampling regime was at least partially respon-\nsible. However, the response was more rapid and pronounced in the LPS-\ninjected \ufb01sh. In the latter, serum iron concentrations decreased to very low\nlevels by day 2 post-injection in the diploid \ufb01sh and by day 3 in the triploid\n\ufb01sh. Pre-treatment iron levels were re-established by about 15 days post-\ninjection in all groups. The data show only slight differences between the\ndiploid and triploid \ufb01sh, but the longer time taken for the triploids to recover\ncomplement activity and the slower onset of the hypoferraemic response\nfollowing injection of LPS, suggest that they may be at a disadvantage\ncompared with their diploid siblings in their defence against bacterial\ninfections.  2001 Academic Press\n\nKey words: diploid, triploid, Atlantic salmon, non-speci\ufb01c immunity, LPS.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nPrevious investigations into the constitutive levels of various non-speci\ufb01c,\nhumoral defence factors of diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon have shown\nlittle difference between the two ploidy states (Langston, 1999). This has also\nbeen shown to be the case in other species of \ufb01sh (Kusuda et al., 1991;\nYamamoto & Iida, 1995a). The comparative susceptibility to diseases of diploid\nand triploid \ufb01sh is still debated, but the majority of published literature shows\n\n*Corresponding author.\n\u2018rPresent address: I-ISRU, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD.\n\n333\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n\nu.(;) 2001 Academic Press"}]
