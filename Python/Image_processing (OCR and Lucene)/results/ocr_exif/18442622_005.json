To engineer cucumber mosaic virus (CMV-Ix) into a gene vector,\ngenome component RNA 3 of the virus .was modi\ufb01ed and split into two sub-\ncomponents, RNA 3A and RNA 3B. In RNA 3A, the open reading frame of the\nmovement protein (MP) was replaced by a reporter gene encoding the green \ufb02u-\norescent protein (GFP), to monitor virus replication and movement. In RNA 3B,\nthe coat protein (CP) gene was eliminated and amultiple cloning site (MCS)\nwas created for foreign gene insertion. Each sub-component alone is defective\nand relies on its companion sub-component to restore full RNA 3 function. The\nvector system was evaluated for its ability to deliver and express the bacterial\nB-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and a modi\ufb01ed bean yellow mosaic virus coat pro-\ntein (BYMV-CP) gene in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Results showed that the\nengineered virus was able to move from cell to cell in the inoculated leaf and en-\nter the minor veins of the inoculated leaf. Foreign gene expression was detected\nin the inoculated leaves. However, intermolecular recombination between RNA\n3A and 3B occurred frequently, preventing ef\ufb01cient systemic expression of the\nforeign gene(s). Modi\ufb01cations and further evaluations are being undertaken to\nimprove the gene delivery system.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of autonomously replicating viruses as genetic vectors for ex-\npression of foreign genes in plants provides attractive biotechnological tools to\nsupplement conventional transgenic technology. Among the numerous advan-\ntages of using viral\u2014based vectors over transgenic plants are quick delivery, high\nlevel expression, and rapid evaluation of target sequences and gene products in a\nvirtually unlimited range of host plants. In recent years, viral-based vectors have"}]
