All\n\n\ufb01sh were bath vaccinated to V. anguillarum at an earlier stage (2 g) in the\n\nfarm of origin prior to the development of the experiments, and therefore only\n\nsecondary and tertiary responses were measured in the group immunised with\n\nthis bacterium. Signi\ufb01cant differences to the controls were observed in the\n\nprimary responses of the head kidney and the spleen to P. damselae ssp.\n\npiscicida and DNP, respectively. Frequency analysis of the production of ASC\n\nsuggests that signi\ufb01cant responses in the gut might be masked by the high\n\n. error variance. The peak of the primary response was observed 4 days earlier\n\n\u00e9  to DNP (18\u201420 days post-immunisation) and it was significantly higher than\n\n' the response to P. damselae ssp. piscicida. Higher numbers of ASC were\n\nobserved in the secondary responses of the head kidney and spleen, although\n\nthey were not statistically signi\ufb01cantly different from the primary levels,\n\nprobably due to the high error variance as supported by the frequency\n\nanalysis. Nevertheless, together with a faster response (peak at 7 days\n\npost-immunisation), the data suggest that memory formation had occurred.\n\nAdditionally, the data suggest that some suppression of the secondary immune\n\nresponse in the gut might have occurred. The head kidney appears to produce\n\nthe highest number of speci\ufb01c ASC of the organs tested. It appears that sea\nbass show a relatively fast but short duration antibody response.\n\n(j, 2001 Academic Press\n\n  \n    \n \n   \n\n        \n\n  \n   \n\n   \n\nKeywords: \ufb01sh, sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, ELISPOT, antibody-\n\nsecreting cells, kinetics, Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida,\nVibrio anguillarum, DNP-KLH.\n\n  \n   \n\n317\n\n1050' 4648/01/040317+15 $35.00/0 '(_\u2018g 2001 Academic Press"}]
