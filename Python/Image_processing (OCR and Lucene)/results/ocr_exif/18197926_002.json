MEsEGUER*\n\nDepartment of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Murcia,\n30100 A/Iurcia, Spain\n\n(Received 27 March 2000, accepted after revision .9 October 2000)\n\nThe natural cytotoxic activity of head\u2014kidney leucocytes from gilthead sea-\nbream (Spams aurata L.), after in. vilro and in uivo vitamin E treatment,\nagainst tumor cells was studied by flow cytometry. Leucocytes were incubated\nin culture medium with different vitamin E supplementations (0-01\u201410,ug\nml \u2019 \u2018) for 6, 24 or 48 h and the results demonstrate that all the assayed vitamin\nE supplementations signi\ufb01cantly enhanced the natural cytotoxic activity of\nleucocytes. To determine the effect of a high dietary level of vitamin E on this\nactivity, fish were fed with 0 (control), 600, 1200 or 1800 mg of vitamin E\nsupplementation kg \"1 diet for 2, 4 or 6 weeks. After 2 and 4 weeks of\ntreatment. the natural cytotoxic activity was significantly enhanced at the\nhighest (18 g kg \"1 diet) and lowest (600 mg kg \"1 diet) vitamin E supplement\ndosage, respectively. No effect of the vitamin E supplemented diet on sea-\nbream leucocyte natural cytotoxic cellactivity was observed after 6 weeks of\ntreatment. 1\u201c 2001 Academic Press\n\nKey words: vitamin E, natural cytotoxic activity, nonspeci\ufb01c cytotoxic cells\n(NCC), leucocytes, gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.).\n\nI. Introduction\n\nVitamin E, besides being a very important lipid\u2014soluble micronutrient (Tu\net al., 1995), is a normal constituent of all cellular membranes, being particu-\nlarly abundant in immune cell membranes, where it is an essential component\nfor cell functioning. Furthermore, due to its antioxidant properties, vitamin E\ninteracts with other nutrients, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids\n(Beharka et al., 1997).\n\nThe role played by vitamin E in several immunological responses has been\nstudied in mammals (Meydani et al., 1986; Moriguchi et al., 1990; Ndiweni\n& Finch, 1995; Beharka et al., 1997) and teleosts (Cowey et al., 1981; Hung\net al., 1982; Blazer & Wolke, 1984; Hardie et al., 1990; Mulero et al., 1998;\nOrtu\ufb01o et al., 2000). Mammals fed vitamin E\u2014depleted diets showed depressed\nimmune activities such as resistance to infection, speci\ufb01c antibody responses,\nsplenic antibody forming cells, in vitro mitogenic responses of lymphocytes,\nreticuloendothelial system clearance or phagocytic index. All these immune\nfunctions were enhanced as a consequence of a-tocopherol intake (Meydani &\n\n*Corresponding author.
