Liischer-Mattli\n\nInstitute of Biochemistry, University of Beme, Beme, Switzerland\n\nAccepted May 23, 2000\n\nSummary. In\ufb02uenza is worldwide one of the deadliest infectious diseases. Lethal\nin\ufb02uenza mutants can unpredictably arise, as in the 1918 pandemic, or in the 1997\nHong Kong in\ufb02uenza outbreak. Vaccines are today the only protective prophy-\nlactic agents, and development of potent new anti-in\ufb02uenza drugs of therapeutic\neffectiveness appears urgent.\nIt is the aim of the present review, to summarize and discuss the different\n_ investigational approaches to this goal. In Medline\u2014 and several internet virology\n database\u2014searches, numerous citations were compiled, and selected according to\ntheir relevance to the different topics discussed.\n\nThe antiviral agents are classi\ufb01ed according to their target in the viral repli-\ncation cycle: proteolytic activation of haemagglutinin, attachment of the virus\nto speci\ufb01c cell-surface receptors, endocytosis and fusion with the endosomal\nmembrane, uncoating of the nucleocapsid, multiplication, i.e. synthesis of viral\nRNA and mRNA, and release of the new virus generation from the host cell\nsurface.\n\nPotential drugs, directed towards each of these replication steps are described\nwith respect to their mechanism of action, antiviral activity, toxic side effects\nand induction of resistance. The most promising candidates for safe and potent\nnew in\ufb02uenza drugs, are antiviral agents, directed towards a virus\u2014speci\ufb01c, well\nconserved target, such as inhibitors of virus-cell fusion, inhibitors of RNA tran-\nscriptase and endonuclease, and inhibitors of neuraminidase.\n\nIt can be hoped that in the near future potent and therapeutically effective\nanti-in\ufb02uenza drugs will be available."}]
