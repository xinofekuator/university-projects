Previously, we found that the E5 protein can be expressed in HPV\u2014 16\ninfected precancerous lesions and cervical cancer [4]. In this study, we investi-\ngated the presence of sequence variants of E5 in HPV\u2014 1 6 infected tissues. Toward\nthis end, we ampli\ufb01ed the E5 gene by polymerase chain reaction from 29 HPV\u2014\nl6 infected tissues including eight normal tissues, seven high grade neoplastic\ntissues (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 14 cervical can-\ncer tissues. Sequence analysis demonstrated that there were three mutational hot\nspots at positions 3979, 4042, and 4077 of the HPV\u2014l6 DNA; these and other mu-\ntations resulted in six variants in the E5 sequence. This resulted in four E5 protein\nmutants, named WTE5 [wild type E5 protein], l4E5, 2lE5 and 56E5. Functional\nanalysis of these four mutant proteins revealed that the transforming activities\nof l4E5, 2lE5 and 56E5 were 0.95, 0.59, and 0.89 fold of WTE5, respectively.\nAlthough E5 was expressed in all of the HSIL and cervical cancer tissues, but in\nonly one of the eight normal tissues tested, only WT E5 protein was found in HSIL\nwhile in cervical cancer tissues both WT and mutant E5 proteins were detected.\nSince these E5 proteins exhibited the same in vitro transforming activity, these\ndata suggest that expression of E5 is important in development and progres-\nsion toward malignancy but mutation of E5 does not affect the transformation\nprocess."}]
