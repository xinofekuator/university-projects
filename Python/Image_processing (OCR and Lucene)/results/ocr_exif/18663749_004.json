Recently, it has been found that non-genotoxic\nphysiological stresses such as heat. cold and low pH also activate p53, which regulates the\nexpression of downstream genes. p53 was found to contribute to heat sensitivity through Bax-\nmediated apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 in the human cancer cells. This study reviews\nheat-induced p53-dependent signal transduction and heat sensitivity via a p53-regulated path-\nway for apoptosis in human cancer cells with identical genetic backgrounds except for p53\nstatus. Furthermore, based on recent reports. it is proposed that p53 status could be a useful\nindicator in predictive assays for hyperthermic cancer therapy. Hyperthermia treatment based\non such predictive assays might improve the outcome and e\ufb02iciency of cancer therapy in the\nfuture. It is further proposed that manipulation of mp53 by glycerol as a chemical chaperone\nmay provide a new cancer therapy for patients with mp53-tumours.\n\nKey words: p53. apoptosis, hyperthermia, cancer therapy.\n\n1. Introduction\n\np53 is known to be a tumour suppressor gene product, because it exerts its\nmultiple effects via regulation of many genes that are closely related to tumour\ngrowth arrest or apoptosis. To regulate the expression of genes. p53 undergoes\nconformational changes that enable it to bind to speci\ufb01c DNA sequences located\non the promoter region ofthe genes. Ofthe genes positively regulated by p53, WAFI\n(wild-type p53 activated fragment 1) is a major mediator of p53-dependent G,\narrest\u201d. It seems that the arrested cells have the opportunity to repair cell damage.\nDuring cell cycle arrest, p53\u2014regulated gadd45 (growth arrest and DNA damage\ninducible 45) may play an important role in the repair of damaged DNA\u201c.\nAlternatively, cells have other mechanisms of removing damaged DNA, i.e. apop-\ntosis as programmed cell death. p53-regulated genes such as Bax (Bcl-associated X\nprotein)5, Fas/APO\u20141 6 and the recently cloned PAG608 7 are all involved in apop-\ntosis induction. In contrast. p53-regulated Mdm-2 (murine double minute 2) func-\ntions in negative feedback regulation of p53 activityx. Based on these functions. p53\nis regarded as the \u2018guardian of the genome\u201d against DNA damaging agentsg. To date,\nit has been reported that the p53 functions are activated by not only genotoxic\nagents, but also various kinds of stress such as heat, cold, low pH or hypoxia.\n\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.\n\nlr1rwviuIimIu/.Im/rnu/ 0/ Hi/m'I/wrmiu ISSN 0265 6736 print ISSN 1464 5157 unlmc I Z(l(ll 'l\u2018u_\\rlor & llrztncis Ltd\nhttp: wxuv.i;xmlf\\:o.uk journals\nI)()l: llI.|()8II ()2(\u00bb5(u'/Jill |()(l(u3(\u00bbU'-l"}]
