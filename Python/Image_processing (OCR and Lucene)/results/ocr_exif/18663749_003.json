This study examined the use of\ninhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis on the response of prostate tumours to hyperthermia.\nThe non-steroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAID) ibuprofen and sulindac, known cyclo-\noxygenase inhibitors that inhibit prostaglandin production, were effective hyperthermia\nsensitizers and augmented growth delay of DU-145 and PC-3 prostate tumours to combined\nradiation and hyperthermia treatment protocols. Pre-treatment of mice with ibuprofen and\nsulindac at hyperthermia sensitizing doses resulted in signi\ufb01cant (p < 0.01) inhibition of\nhyperthemia-induced serum prostaglandin E3.

Introduction\n\nRecent studies have shown that non-steroidal anti\u2014in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAID)\nmay be useful in cancer treatment, either alone or in combination with radiation\ntherapyl\u20194. The growth of the HT\u201429 human colon carcinoma cells is inhibited by\nsulindac and other NSAIDM\u2019. In addition, recent studies have shown that the\nNSAID indomethacin can improve the anti\u2014tumour effects of ionizing radiation in\nprostaglandin\u2014producing transplanted murine sarcomas7. It has recently been shown\nthat the NSAID ibuprofen can induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells and sensitize such cells\nto ionizing radiation in tissue cultures. The NSAID classically exert their analgesic\nand anti\u2014in\ufb02ammatory functions through the inhibition ofthe enzymes Cyclooxygen-\nase 1 (COX 1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2), the key enzymes in the synthesis of the\n\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed. e-mail: stuart_calderwood@dfci.\nharvard.edu\n\nIrIleI'nuIi()Im/ Juurnul <3] H_1\u2018p('rt/iermiu ISSN 026542736 print ISSN I46-1\u20145l57 online 1 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd\nhttp:\u2019/www.tandf.co,ukJournals\nDOI: 10.1080/02656730110058600"}]
