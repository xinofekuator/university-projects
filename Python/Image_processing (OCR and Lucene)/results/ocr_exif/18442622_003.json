Minagawa and Y. Yanagi\n\nDepartment of Virology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences,\nKyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan\n\nAccepted June 2, 2000\n\nSummary. In C.B\u201417 severe combined immunode\ufb01ciency (SCID) mice, corneal\nchallenge with herpes simplex virus\u2014l (HSV\u20141) KOS strain usually leads to fatal\nencephalitis. With the transfer of T cells from immunized BALB/c mice, these\nSCID mice developed a latent HSV\u20141 infection. In order to determine the respon-\nsible T cell subset, fractionated immune T cells were transferred. Those SCID\nmice transferred with immune CD4+T cell\u2014enriched fraction developed latent\nHSV\u20141 infection in their trigeminal ganglia. Their splenocytes had an increased\npercentage of CD4+T cells and showed a proliferative response against HSV\u20141.\nThe transfer of CD8+T cells increased survival in the acute infection, but their\nengraftment seemed less needed for latency than that of CD4+T cells. Mice\nthat received immune serum survived without developing latent HSV\u20141 infec-\ntion. Some latently infected SCID mice had anti\u2014HSV antibodies while others\ndid not, indicating that the engraftment of antibody-producing B cells was not\nrequired for latency. Thus, immune CD4+T cells were important for the survival\nof SCID mice with latent HSV\u20141 infection. This animal model should be useful\nfor investigation of latency/reactivation of HSV\u20141.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHerpes simplex virus\u2014l (HSV\u20141) establishes a latent infection in neurons, with\noccasional or induced reactivation of the infectious virus [17, 42, 43]. The mech-\nanism of HSV\u20141 latency has been studied in depth with animal models [18, 35,\n42], especially with the mouse skin\u2014dorsal root ganglion and the eye\u2014trigeminal\nganglion models. These studies have revealed the importance of both T and B\ncells for the control of HSV\u20141 infection [31]. The role of immune CD4+T cells in\nthe HSV latency has been addressed by recent investigations [8, 18, 32]. CD8+T\ncells are also important for the prevention and cure of recurrent HSV lesions in"}]
