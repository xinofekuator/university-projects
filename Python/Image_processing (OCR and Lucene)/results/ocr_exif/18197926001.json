The LC,\u2014_,, of copper on P. gonionotus at\n24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h were estimated as 2-17, 0-91, 0-57, 0-53 and 0-42 mg l\" 1,\nrespectively. To determine the effect of copper on the immune system, \ufb01sh\nwere exposed for 66 days to 0-05, 0-10 and 0-15 mg Cu l\" \u2018. After 56 days of\ninitial exposure to copper, \ufb01sh were challenged with 0-1 ml of 4-5 X 105 cfu\nml \" \u2018 formalin killed A. hydrophila and maintained in the same concentration\nof copper. After the challenge, the immune response was monitored for\n2 weeks using haematological and serological assays. During the initial phase\nof exposure to copper, signi\ufb01cant changes were noted in the white blood cell,\nlysozyme, potential killing activity, total plasma protein, total immunoglobu-\nlin and haematocrit levels between the control and treated \ufb01sh. One week\nafter challenge with A. hydrophila, there was a signi\ufb01cant increase in the\nvalues of white blood Cells. total protein and total immunoglobulin compared\nto the values before the challenge. However, these values were not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different (P>0-05) between the control and the treated \ufb01sh. In contrast,\nNBT and lysozyme assays exhibited a signi\ufb01cant difference (P<0-05) in \ufb01sh\nexposed to 0-10 mg Cu 1 1 (0-525i:0-17; 24-4213-35 X 10Z,umg ml\u201d) and\n0-15 mg Cu 1\"\u2018 (0-536i0-19: 21-78i 1-29 >< 102;1mg ml \u2018) compared to the\ncontrol (0746 1 0-81; 30-73 i 5-42 X 103 ,umg ml \u2018 1) after the bacterial challenge\n(day 61). There was however no signi\ufb01cant difference (P>0-05) in NBT and\nlysozyme levels in \ufb01sh exposed to lower level of copper (0-05 mg Cu 1 1),\nsuggesting the absence of immunosuppressive effects at lower level of\nexposure.
