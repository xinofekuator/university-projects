A method to quantify the SAR from photographs of the sensor array\u2014the so-called\n\u2018Power Stepping Technique\u2019\u2014has already been proposed. This paper presents a new approach\nto the quantitative determination of the SAR pro\ufb01les in a liquid phantom exposed to electro-\nmagnetic \ufb01elds from the Sigma-60 applicator (BSD-2000 system for deep regional hyper-\nthermia). The method is based on the construction of a \u2018calibration curve\u2018 modelling the\nlight-output of an E-\ufb01eld sensor as a function of the supplied voltage and on the use of a\nreference light source to \u2018normalize\u2019 the light-output readings from the photos of the sensor\narray, in order to minimize the errors introduced by the non-uniformity of the photographic\nprocess. Once the calibration curve is obtained, it is possible, with only one photo. to obtain\nthe quantitative SAR distribution in the operating conditions. For this reason, this method is\nsuitable for equipment characterization and also for the control of the repeatability of power\ndeposition in time.\n\nKey words: SAR distributions, hyperthermia quality assurance.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe application in clinical oncology of the deep regional radio-frequency induced\nhyperthermia therapy requires a thorough characterization and control of the equip-\nment used to deliver the power for the heating' 5.\n\nDeep regional hyperthermia systems consist, regarding the power delivery, of\nantenna arrays supplying electromagnetic \ufb01elds in the radio frequency range, and\nwith electric component mainly parallel to antenna direction: the resultant electro-\nmagnetic \ufb01eld is given by the superposition of the \ufb01elds produced by each antenna.\nThese systems can focalize the electromagnetic \ufb01eld in speci\ufb01c regions, creating, in\nthese areas, constructive interference amongst the \ufb01elds produced by each antenna:\nthe focus is controlled acting on the signal frequency (the same for each antenna),\nand on the phase shift and the relative amplitude of the signals coming from each\ndifferent antenna\u201c.\n\nThe physical parameter typically used for the description of the interaction\nbetween electromagnetic \ufb01eld and matter is the Speci\ufb01c Absorption Rate (SAR).\nSpecial attention has to be given, in the characterization and control of a system\n\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed. e-mail: \ufb01sica.sanitaria.ocm@\nmail.azosp.vr.it\n\nIrlmwuiimlul .lmmIul 0/ H_r[u'r//1r'rmiu ISSN 02(>.\u2018-6736 print ISSN I464 5|57 onlinc l 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd\nhltpz vtww.lundf.co.ukjournals\nD0l: l0.l0X() ()2656730l l0(l55964"}]
