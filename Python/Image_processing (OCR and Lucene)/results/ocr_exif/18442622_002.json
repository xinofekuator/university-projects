We have sequenced 1873 nucleotides from the 3\u2019-end region of a\nsun\ufb02ower potyvirus genome including the 3\u2019\u2014NIb protein coding region (813 nu-\ncleotides), the entire coat protein coding region (807 nucleotides) and 3'\u2014NCR\n(253 nucleotides), excluding the poly (A) tail. Amino acids identity of the whole\nCP between the sun\ufb02ower virus and Potyvirus members ranged from 49.5%\n(SCMV) to 81.5% (PVY\u2014NsNr), and the core ranged from 55% (TVMV) to 87%\n(PVY-NsNr; PepMoV). The 3\u2019-NCR nucleotides showed 38.7% homology to\nPeSMV and 61% to PepMoV-C. The sequence of 3\u2019end region and analysis of\nphylogenetic relationships suggest this sun\ufb02ower virus could belong to PVY sub-\ngroup and the name of \u201csun\ufb02ower chlorotic mottle virus\u201d (SuCMoV) is proposed.\nThis is the \ufb01rst report on the partial nucleotide sequence of a potyvirus infecting\nsun\ufb02ower.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSun\ufb02ower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the most important oilseed crops in\nArgentina, where approximately 3,500,000 ha are planted yearly. A potyvirus\nwhich causes systemic chlorotic mottling and plant stunting, has been isolated\nfrom commercial sun\ufb02ower crops [13] and was biologically and serologically\ncharacterized. The virus is aphid transmitted in non-persistent manner, induces\ncytoplasmic inclusions, particles are long \ufb02exuous shaped of 775 nm and have an\nintermediate host range restricted mainly to members of the Asteraceae family\n[7]. However, its taxonomic relation with other potyvimses has not been worked\nout yet.\n\nSequence comparison of the coat protein (CP) can be used to identify and\ndifferentiate distinct potyvirus species and strains [20, 29].
